This week's project involves a very important aspect of web developement which is ACCESIBILITY. I built this website to help people with disabilites. Web accessibility would be considered for businesses because it helps to access a website easily for people with disabilities. Using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Is adventegous for businesses to build their website accessible so that would help to rank higher in search engines such as Google. In this project I was working from a starter code which was given and I styled everything to make it readable.
